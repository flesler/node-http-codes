# node-http-codes

## Description
Map of HTTP status messages to codes based on [Node's built-in map](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_status_codes) in reverse.

## Installation
ItÂ´s a simple json file, so you just need to import it into your project

## Why use this over others like it

- It's ultra simple, doesn't get simpler than this
- It's based on [Node's built-in map](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_status_codes) in reverse meaning it will auto-update if the built-in does.
- It doesn't depend on other libraries
- Works on the nodejs and any browser
 
## The actual map

You can see the generated map by running:

    $ npm run build
